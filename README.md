- This is an open loop PID autotuner using a novel s-curve inflection point test method. Tuning parameters are typically determined in about Â½Tau on a first-order system with time delay. Full 5Tau testing and multiple serial output options are provided.

    - Compatible with [PID_v1](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library), [QuickPID](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID) and others
    - Serial output option for [PID Tuner](https://pidtuner.com/#/)
    - Tested using [Temperature Control Lab](http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl)
